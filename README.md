## Commands And Steps-Django


## Installation

#### Create a virtual environment

```bash
  python3 -m venv myvenv

```
#### Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```
#### Install Django
```bash
pip install django
```
#### Create a new Django project
```
django-admin startproject portfolio
```
This command will create a new directory named projectname in your current directory, which will contain the basic structure for a Django project. It will also create a manage.py file, which can be used to run various administrative tasks such as starting the development server, creating database tables, and running tests.

#### Change directory into the new project
```bash
cd portfolio
```
#### Create a new app within the project
```bash
python manage.py startapp my_profile
```
#### Run the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

By following the above steps, you can create a Django project and app, and run it on a local server. From here, you can begin to add your own custom styling and content to create a unique and visually appealing online resume.
