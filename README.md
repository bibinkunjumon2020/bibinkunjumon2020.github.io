Creating a website to display your resume is a great way to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers and clients in a modern and interactive format. With the right design and content, your online resume can help you stand out from the competition and make a lasting impression on your visitors.

Create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv myvenv
Activate the virtual environment:
source myvenv/bin/activate
Install Django:
pip install django
Create a new Django project:
django-admin startproject projectname
This command will create a new directory named projectname in your current directory, which will contain the basic structure for a Django project. It will also create a manage.py file, which can be used to run various administrative tasks such as starting the development server, creating database tables, and running tests.
Change directory into the new project:
cd projectname
Create a new app within the project:
python manage.py startapp myapp
Run the server:
python manage.py runserver
