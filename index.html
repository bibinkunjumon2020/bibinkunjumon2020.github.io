					<p class="card-text">
					<p>The program aims to train researchers and developers with a <strong>distinctive set of
							competencies</strong> at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence who
						exhibit a <em>systematic and critical thinking</em> and can solve complex tasks using a range of
						industrial and service robotics apps associated with the development of mathematical,
						algorithmical, and program software to design, optimize, and humanize robots, organize
						<em>human-machine and machine-to-machine interactions</em>, as well as systems for
						<strong>traffic planning, automatic control, and decision-making</strong>.
					</p>

					<p>Graduates of the program can become experts in <strong>robot-enabled manipulation and
							manufacturing</strong>, <strong>autonomous ground, water, and air vehicles</strong> and
						<strong>smart transportation</strong>, <strong>wearable, collaborative, and medical
							robotics</strong>; medicine, namely, <strong>surgical robotic technologies</strong>,
						development of various types of <strong>exoskeletons</strong> and mobile platforms for patientsâ€™
						transportation, as well as <strong>robotic limbs construction</strong>. They can also work at
						research institutions and design offices (design and construction of complex technical systems).
						As a whole, graduates will be in high demand in all spheres that use machines and equipment that
