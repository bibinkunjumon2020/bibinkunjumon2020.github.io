					<p class="card-text">
						<p>In my journey as a software engineer, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting and cutting-edge project: the development of an AI chatbot centered around custom data-based answering. This project pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve, and I'm proud to share my experience and contributions to it.</p>
						
						<h4>Project Overview:</h4>
						
						<p>The primary objective of this project was to create an AI chatbot capable of providing precise responses based solely on the information contained within its database, without relying on external knowledge sources. This approach ensured that the chatbot's responses were highly tailored to the specific dataset it had access to, making it a valuable tool for applications that require domain-specific knowledge.</p>
						
						<h4>Techniques and Tools Utilized:</h4>
						
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Embedding with Vector Store:</strong> To achieve this unique data-based answering approach, we employed embedding with a vector store. This enabled us to query the document effectively and retrieve relevant content using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models.</li>
							<li><strong>OpenAI Agent:</strong> We incorporated the OpenAI agent for seamless integration and smooth chat interactions. This agent allowed us to create a user-friendly conversational interface.</li>
							<li><strong>Metadata Creation:</strong> We meticulously structured metadata to enhance the chatbot's understanding of the content, facilitating more accurate responses.</li>
							<li><strong>Node Parsing and Function Calling:</strong> To maximize the accuracy of content retrieval from custom data, we implemented techniques like node parsing and function calling.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Challenges and Research Orientation:</h4>
						
						<p>This project was research-oriented, primarily due to the unique nature of our goal. We faced the challenge of limited existing web sources or resources to realize our vision of a chatbot that relies exclusively on its internal dataset. This required a deep dive into AI techniques and creative problem-solving.</p>
						
						<h4>My Role:</h4>
						
						<p>As part of the team, I was responsible for the backend server activities. My educational background, which includes a master's degree and experience in machine learning and neural network structuring, made me well-suited for handling the complex backend tasks.</p>
						
						<h4>Achievements:</h4>
						
						<p>Our team's dedication and hard work paid off as we achieved an astonishing 99 percent accuracy in the performance of the AI assistant. This accomplishment positions our chatbot as a potential candidate for various applications, such as a robot receptionist with customized knowledge or an automated call center employee.</p>
						
						<p>This project represents not only a technological milestone but also a testament to the endless possibilities of AI. It showcases the potential for AI to transform how we access and interact with data, offering personalized and accurate responses that can be harnessed across various industries.</p>
						
						<p>I am excited to continue exploring the world of AI and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in technology.</p>

					<h5 class="card-title" style="color: rgb(226, 125, 43);"><strong>Project : SayChatGPT - TelegramBot Conversations with OpenAI-GPT</strong></h5>
					<p class="card-text">
						
						<p>During my journey as a Masters Student, I had the opportunity for developing an innovative Telegram chat bot for ITMO University known as SayChatGPT. This remarkable bot integrates the capabilities of OpenAI models, including GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and DALL·E2, to deliver an exceptional user experience. Below, I will provide an overview of the features and commands within SayChatGPT that offer enhanced language processing and interactive interactions.</p>
						
						<h4>Overview:</h4>
						
						<p>SayChatGPT is not your ordinary chat bot; it's a sophisticated fusion of TelegramBot and OpenAI-GPT technologies, aimed at transforming user interactions. The integration of GPT allows the bot to generate context-aware responses, making conversations more natural and engaging. Langchain enhances language processing capabilities, enabling the bot to interact with document files without the need for extensive model fine-tuning.</p>
						
						<p>With SayChatGPT, users can enjoy interactive and personalized conversations, receive relevant information, and even engage in dynamic storytelling experiences.</p>
						
						<h4>Descriptions of Key Bot Commands:</h4>
						
						<ul>
							<li><strong>/info:</strong> This command provides an overview of the bot's purpose and lists all available commands within the bot environment.</li>
							<li><strong>/chatgpt - ChatGPT 💬:</strong> Engage in interactive conversations with ChatGPT, a friendly AI chatbot known for providing natural and engaging responses. Ask questions, discuss various topics, or simply have a fun chat with ChatGPT.</li>
							<li><strong>/davincigpt - ChatDavinci 💭:</strong> Initiate conversations with ChatDavinci, a sophisticated AI chatbot powered by the renowned Davinci model. ChatDavinci excels in understanding language and context, leading to insightful and nuanced discussions.</li>
							<li><strong>/image - Your Thoughts As Image 🧚‍♀️:</strong> Experience the magic of AI with this command, which transforms text descriptions into vivid and imaginative images. Simply describe your desired image, and watch as AI brings your thoughts to life.</li>
							<li><strong>/askyourbook - Chat Your File 🙋‍♂:</strong> Upload text documents in any format and receive comprehensive assistance. Chat Your File provides summaries, clarifications, and simplified explanations for complex concepts within your documents.</li>
							<li><strong>/selectfile - Choose File to Chat 🗃️:</strong> Select a file from your device for an interactive chat session. The bot guides you through a conversation, offering insights based on the content of the file.</li>
							<li><strong>/uploadfile - Upload Your File 📚:</strong> Upload a specific document directly to the bot, enabling in-depth discussions about the document's content.</li>
